# MAC0425-Artificial Inteligence
All the programs made for the [Artificial Inteligence](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0425) class from [IME-USP](https://www.ime.usp.br/).

For this class we followed the UC Berkeley [CS188 Intro to AI Pac-Man Project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) with some changes and not to it's fullest.

For every step of the project you can read what was required from the students in the PDF of every step, plus the answers to the question proposed by the teacher.

## [EP01](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)
We had to implement a DFS, BFS, IDS and A* search algorithm.

## [EP02](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)
We had to implement the minimax with and without the aplha-beta pruning and the expectimax algorithm. And make two evaluation functions, one for actions and other for states.
