# MAC0425-Artificial Inteligence
All the programs made for the [Artificial Inteligence](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0425) class from [IME-USP](https://www.ime.usp.br/).

For this class we followed the UC Berkeley [CS188 Intro to AI Pac-Man Project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) with some changes and not to it's fullest.

For every step of the project you can read what was required from the students in the PDF of every step, plus the answers to the question proposed by the teacher, but all of these are in portuguese.

## [EP01](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)
We had to implement a generic [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [IDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) and [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) search algorithms.

## [EP02](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)
We had to implement the multiagent minimax (with and without the [aplha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)) and the expectimax algorithm. And make two evaluation functions, one for actions and the other for states.      


## [EP03](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)
We had to solve a MDP (finding the optimal policy) and implement the Q-learning algorithm in two different ways, one with weights and one based in iterations.
